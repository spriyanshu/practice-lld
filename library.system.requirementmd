# Library Management System - Low Level Design Requirements

## Problem Statement

Design and implement a comprehensive Library Management System that efficiently handles book inventory, member registration, and borrowing/returning operations while maintaining high code quality, modularity, and extensibility.

## Core Functional Requirements

### 1. Book Management

- **Add Books**: System should support adding different types of books (Fiction, Non-Fiction, etc.) to the library inventory
- **Book Categorization**: Each book must have essential attributes including title, author, ISBN, and genre
- **Duplicate Prevention**: Prevent addition of books with duplicate ISBNs
- **Book Retrieval**: Enable searching and retrieval of books by ISBN
- **Extensible Book Types**: Support for adding new book categories without modifying existing code

### 2. Member Management

- **Member Registration**: Register new library members with unique member IDs
- **Member Information**: Store and manage member details including name and unique identifier
- **Duplicate Prevention**: Prevent registration of members with duplicate IDs
- **Member Lookup**: Retrieve member information by member ID
- **Flexible Member Creation**: Support step-by-step member creation process

### 3. Borrowing and Returning System

- **Individual Book Borrowing**: Allow members to borrow individual books
- **Bulk Operations**: Support borrowing multiple books in a single transaction
- **Return Processing**: Handle book returns with proper validation
- **Availability Tracking**: Track which books are currently borrowed and by whom
- **Business Rules Enforcement**:
  - Members cannot borrow already borrowed books
  - Only registered members can borrow books
  - Only existing books can be borrowed
  - Books can only be returned if they were actually borrowed

### 4. Composite Item Handling

- **Single Item Operations**: Handle individual book borrowing
- **Collection Operations**: Support borrowing collections of books as a single unit
- **Unified Interface**: Treat single books and collections uniformly for borrowing operations

### 5. External System Integration

- **Data Adaptation**: Handle book data from external systems with different field names and formats
- **Flexible Input Processing**: Convert external book representations to internal system format
