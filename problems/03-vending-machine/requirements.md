# Vending Machine - Requirements Documentation

## 📋 Problem Overview

**Difficulty**: Easy  
**Time Limit**: 25min  
**Topics**: State pattern, Factory pattern

## 🎯 Business Context

Vending machines dispense products (snacks, drinks) in response to user input and payment. Designing a vending machine (often a coffee machine) is a typical LLD interview example:contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}. It demonstrates state management and inventory control in OOP.

## 📝 Problem Statement

Design a vending machine system that allows users to select products and pay for them. The system should manage inventory of products, accept currency (coins/notes), dispense products, and return change if necessary.

## ✅ Functional Requirements

### Core Features
1. **Support multiple product types, each with a stock count**
2. **Accept payments and calculate change to return if overpaid**
3. **Dispense the correct product when enough payment is received**
4. **Handle restocking of products and refill of change/change maker**
5. **Report or log inventory levels and transaction history**

## 🚫 Constraints & Assumptions

### Technical Constraints
- Limited inventory for each product (cannot dispense if out of stock)
- Coin change availability may limit ability to give exact change
- Assume only exact currency denominations are used (e.g., certain coin values)
- No network connectivity assumed (standalone machine)
- Concurrent operations (multiple coin insertions) may be considered but can assume sequential transactions

## 🎨 Design Patterns to Consider

### Primary Topics
- **State pattern**: Consider how this applies to the problem
- **Factory pattern**: Consider how this applies to the problem

### Secondary Topics
- **Exception handling**: May be relevant for advanced implementation
- **User input/output**: May be relevant for advanced implementation

## 🧪 Test Cases to Consider

### Happy Path
1. Basic functionality works as expected
2. Multiple operations work in sequence
3. System handles normal load

### Edge Cases
1. Empty/null inputs
2. Boundary conditions
3. Maximum capacity scenarios

### Error Scenarios
1. Invalid operations
2. Resource conflicts
3. System constraints violations

## 📊 Success Criteria

- [ ] All functional requirements implemented
- [ ] Clean, maintainable code structure
- [ ] Proper error handling
- [ ] Thread safety (if applicable)
- [ ] Test coverage for main scenarios
- [ ] Time complexity within reasonable bounds

## 🔍 Questions to Clarify

1. What should happen in edge cases not explicitly mentioned?
2. Are there specific performance requirements?
3. Should the system handle concurrent operations?
4. What level of error reporting is expected?

**Note**: Focus on implementing the core requirements first, then add enhancements if time permits.
