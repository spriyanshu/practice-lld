# Restaurant Ordering System - Requirements Documentation

## 📋 Problem Overview

**Difficulty**: Medium  
**Time Limit**: 35min  
**Topics**: Order processing, State management

## 🎯 Business Context

A restaurant ordering system (like Zomato or a POS system) manages menus, orders, and billing. Designing this system tests class design for menu items, orders, and payments. Interviews often ask this question to evaluate handling of multiple components like kitchen and delivery (A common interview question:contentReference[oaicite:11]{index=11}).

## 📝 Problem Statement

Design a restaurant ordering system. The system should manage restaurants, menus, and customer orders. It should allow placing orders for dishes, updating order status, and generating bills.

## ✅ Functional Requirements

### Core Features
1. **Define restaurant menus with categories (appetizers, entrees, etc.) and items with prices**
2. **Place an order for one or more dishes at a restaurant (in-restaurant or for delivery)**
3. **Track order status (e.g., placed, preparing, delivered)**
4. **Calculate order total and apply taxes or discounts**
5. **Support order cancellations or modifications before preparation**

## 🚫 Constraints & Assumptions

### Technical Constraints
- Assume a single restaurant or a small chain (no multi-city scaling)
- Inventory management is out of scope (assume all menu items are in stock)
- Concurrent orders are expected but handled independently
- Payment handling is simplified (not focusing on actual payment gateway)
- Delivery coordination (address, riders) can be optional extension

## 🎨 Design Patterns to Consider

### Primary Topics
- **Order processing**: Consider how this applies to the problem
- **State management**: Consider how this applies to the problem

### Secondary Topics
- **Integration with payment systems**: May be relevant for advanced implementation
- **User notifications**: May be relevant for advanced implementation

## 🧪 Test Cases to Consider

### Happy Path
1. Basic functionality works as expected
2. Multiple operations work in sequence
3. System handles normal load

### Edge Cases
1. Empty/null inputs
2. Boundary conditions
3. Maximum capacity scenarios

### Error Scenarios
1. Invalid operations
2. Resource conflicts
3. System constraints violations

## 📊 Success Criteria

- [ ] All functional requirements implemented
- [ ] Clean, maintainable code structure
- [ ] Proper error handling
- [ ] Thread safety (if applicable)
- [ ] Test coverage for main scenarios
- [ ] Time complexity within reasonable bounds

## 🔍 Questions to Clarify

1. What should happen in edge cases not explicitly mentioned?
2. Are there specific performance requirements?
3. Should the system handle concurrent operations?
4. What level of error reporting is expected?
