# Digital Wallet Service - Requirements Documentation

## 📋 Problem Overview

**Difficulty**: Medium  
**Time Limit**: 35min  
**Topics**: Transaction management, Concurrency

## 🎯 Business Context

A digital wallet service allows users to store funds and make payments. Designing a wallet service tests handling of transactions and account balance updates. It is sometimes asked as a variation on payment systems (A frequent interview question:contentReference[oaicite:17]{index=17}).

## 📝 Problem Statement

Design a digital wallet system. The system should allow users to load money into their wallet, view balance, and transfer money to other users or make payments.

## ✅ Functional Requirements

### Core Features
1. **User accounts with unique wallet balances**
2. **Deposit funds into the wallet (e.g., link bank account or add cash)**
3. **Transfer funds between wallets (peer-to-peer)**
4. **Maintain transaction history and update balances atomically**
5. **Provide balance inquiry functionality**

## 🚫 Constraints & Assumptions

### Technical Constraints
- Strong consistency: ensure no double-spending (transactions are atomic)
- Balance cannot go negative (no credit extension)
- Single currency (ignore multiple currencies and conversion)
- Assume no external payment gateway integration (focus on wallet logic)
- Concurrent transfers and updates must be handled correctly

## 🎨 Design Patterns to Consider

### Primary Topics
- **Transaction management**: Consider how this applies to the problem
- **Concurrency**: Consider how this applies to the problem

### Secondary Topics
- **Financial operations**: May be relevant for advanced implementation
- **Security (basic)**: May be relevant for advanced implementation

## 🧪 Test Cases to Consider

### Happy Path
1. Basic functionality works as expected
2. Multiple operations work in sequence
3. System handles normal load

### Edge Cases
1. Empty/null inputs
2. Boundary conditions
3. Maximum capacity scenarios

### Error Scenarios
1. Invalid operations
2. Resource conflicts
3. System constraints violations

## 📊 Success Criteria

- [ ] All functional requirements implemented
- [ ] Clean, maintainable code structure
- [ ] Proper error handling
- [ ] Thread safety (if applicable)
- [ ] Test coverage for main scenarios
- [ ] Time complexity within reasonable bounds

## 🔍 Questions to Clarify

1. What should happen in edge cases not explicitly mentioned?
2. Are there specific performance requirements?
3. Should the system handle concurrent operations?
4. What level of error reporting is expected?
