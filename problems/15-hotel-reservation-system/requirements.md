# Hotel Reservation System - Requirements Documentation

## 📋 Problem Overview

**Difficulty**: Medium  
**Time Limit**: 35min  
**Topics**: Calendar scheduling, Object-oriented modelling

## 🎯 Business Context

A hotel reservation system manages room bookings for guests. This involves classes for hotels, rooms, and reservations. It's a typical interview scenario to test availability checking and booking logic (A known design problem:contentReference[oaicite:13]{index=13}).

## 📝 Problem Statement

Design a hotel reservation system. The system should manage multiple hotels and rooms, and allow customers to search for available rooms by date and book them for specific durations.

## ✅ Functional Requirements

### Core Features
1. **Maintain list of hotels and rooms (each room has a type and price)**
2. **Check room availability for given date ranges**
3. **Create reservations that lock a room for a guest for the requested dates**
4. **Cancel reservations and release rooms back to availability**
5. **Avoid double-booking of the same room on overlapping dates**

## 🚫 Constraints & Assumptions

### Technical Constraints
- Rooms are uniquely identified within each hotel
- Assume each room can only have one reservation per date
- Fixed room rates (ignore dynamic pricing models)
- No need to handle payments; focus on booking logic
- Concurrency: multiple booking attempts may occur at once

## 🎨 Design Patterns to Consider

### Primary Topics
- **Calendar scheduling**: Consider how this applies to the problem
- **Object-oriented modelling**: Consider how this applies to the problem

### Secondary Topics
- **Concurrency**: May be relevant for advanced implementation
- **Data persistence (e.g. database)**: May be relevant for advanced implementation

## 🧪 Test Cases to Consider

### Happy Path
1. Basic functionality works as expected
2. Multiple operations work in sequence
3. System handles normal load

### Edge Cases
1. Empty/null inputs
2. Boundary conditions
3. Maximum capacity scenarios

### Error Scenarios
1. Invalid operations
2. Resource conflicts
3. System constraints violations

## 📊 Success Criteria

- [ ] All functional requirements implemented
- [ ] Clean, maintainable code structure
- [ ] Proper error handling
- [ ] Thread safety (if applicable)
- [ ] Test coverage for main scenarios
- [ ] Time complexity within reasonable bounds

## 🔍 Questions to Clarify

1. What should happen in edge cases not explicitly mentioned?
2. Are there specific performance requirements?
3. Should the system handle concurrent operations?
4. What level of error reporting is expected?
