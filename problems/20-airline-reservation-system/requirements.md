# Airline Reservation System - Requirements Documentation

## 📋 Problem Overview

**Difficulty**: Medium  
**Time Limit**: 35min  
**Topics**: Reservation management, Data modeling

## 🎯 Business Context

An airline reservation system manages flight seat bookings and schedules. It is a familiar interview question (similar to hotel booking) requiring class design for flights, seats, and passenger reservations (A standard LLD problem:contentReference[oaicite:18]{index=18}).

## 📝 Problem Statement

Design an airline reservation system. The system should allow customers to search for flights, select seats, and book reservations.

## ✅ Functional Requirements

### Core Features
1. **Maintain flights with schedule and seat inventory (seat map)**
2. **Search flights by origin, destination, and date**
3. **Book a seat for a passenger on a specific flight (assign seat and generate ticket)**
4. **Cancel bookings and free up seats**
5. **Handle basic flight cancellation (all seats become available again)**

## 🚫 Constraints & Assumptions

### Technical Constraints
- Seats are uniquely identified within each flight
- Prevent double-booking of the same seat on a flight
- Assume flights have fixed schedules (no on-the-fly changes)
- Simplify pricing (flat fare per flight, ignore classes like economy/business)
- Concurrent booking attempts for the same seat should be synchronized

## 🎨 Design Patterns to Consider

### Primary Topics
- **Reservation management**: Consider how this applies to the problem
- **Data modeling**: Consider how this applies to the problem

### Secondary Topics
- **Concurrency**: May be relevant for advanced implementation
- **High availability**: May be relevant for advanced implementation

## 🧪 Test Cases to Consider

### Happy Path
1. Basic functionality works as expected
2. Multiple operations work in sequence
3. System handles normal load

### Edge Cases
1. Empty/null inputs
2. Boundary conditions
3. Maximum capacity scenarios

### Error Scenarios
1. Invalid operations
2. Resource conflicts
3. System constraints violations

## 📊 Success Criteria

- [ ] All functional requirements implemented
- [ ] Clean, maintainable code structure
- [ ] Proper error handling
- [ ] Thread safety (if applicable)
- [ ] Test coverage for main scenarios
- [ ] Time complexity within reasonable bounds

## 🔍 Questions to Clarify

1. What should happen in edge cases not explicitly mentioned?
2. Are there specific performance requirements?
3. Should the system handle concurrent operations?
4. What level of error reporting is expected?

**Note**: Focus on implementing the core requirements first, then add enhancements if time permits.
