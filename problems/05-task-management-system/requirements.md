# Task Management System - Requirements Documentation

## 📋 Problem Overview

**Difficulty**: Easy  
**Time Limit**: 25min  
**Topics**: Object-oriented design, Observer pattern

## 🎯 Business Context

A task or to-do management system (like Trello or Jira) helps teams track work. Designing such a system is a common interview question that tests object-oriented design skills:contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}. It involves modelling users, tasks, projects, and permissions.

## 📝 Problem Statement

Design a task management system where users can create tasks, assign them to team members, and track status. Include features like task prioritization, deadlines, and collaboration (e.g., comments or assignment).

## ✅ Functional Requirements

### Core Features
1. **Create, update, and delete tasks with attributes (title, description, due date, priority)**
2. **Assign tasks to users or teams, and change task status (e.g., To Do, In Progress, Done)**
3. **Organize tasks into projects or boards**
4. **Support adding comments or updates to tasks for collaboration**
5. **Provide role-based access (admins, normal users) and notifications on updates**

## 🚫 Constraints & Assumptions

### Technical Constraints
- Assume a single application instance (no distributed issues)
- Fixed set of statuses and priority levels
- No need for real-time collaboration editing (simple comment tracking)
- Concurrency: multiple users may update different tasks simultaneously
- Data persistence assumed but database schema design is out of scope

## 🎨 Design Patterns to Consider

### Primary Topics
- **Object-oriented design**: Consider how this applies to the problem
- **Observer pattern**: Consider how this applies to the problem

### Secondary Topics
- **Access control**: May be relevant for advanced implementation
- **Notifications**: May be relevant for advanced implementation

## 🧪 Test Cases to Consider

### Happy Path
1. Basic functionality works as expected
2. Multiple operations work in sequence
3. System handles normal load

### Edge Cases
1. Empty/null inputs
2. Boundary conditions
3. Maximum capacity scenarios

### Error Scenarios
1. Invalid operations
2. Resource conflicts
3. System constraints violations

## 📊 Success Criteria

- [ ] All functional requirements implemented
- [ ] Clean, maintainable code structure
- [ ] Proper error handling
- [ ] Thread safety (if applicable)
- [ ] Test coverage for main scenarios
- [ ] Time complexity within reasonable bounds

## 🔍 Questions to Clarify

1. What should happen in edge cases not explicitly mentioned?
2. Are there specific performance requirements?
3. Should the system handle concurrent operations?
4. What level of error reporting is expected?
