# Meeting Room Scheduler - Requirements Documentation

## 📋 Problem Overview

**Difficulty**: Medium  
**Time Limit**: 35min  
**Topics**: Scheduling algorithms, Data modelling

## 🎯 Business Context

Scheduling meetings in conference rooms is a realistic office application. The design involves managing multiple rooms, timeslots, and participants. Interviewers may ask to design a meeting scheduler to test event scheduling logic.

## 📝 Problem Statement

Design a meeting room scheduler for an office building with multiple rooms. The system should allow booking a room for a meeting at a specified time, prevent double-booking, and list available time slots.

## ✅ Functional Requirements

### Core Features
1. **Add meeting rooms with capacities and facilities**
2. **Book a meeting in a room for a given date/time range with a list of participants**
3. **Check availability: reject bookings that conflict with existing ones**
4. **Cancel or modify existing meetings**
5. **List all meetings for a given time period or room**

## 🚫 Constraints & Assumptions

### Technical Constraints
- Each meeting room can host at most one meeting at a time
- Time slots are continuous (e.g., meetings can start/end at any time)
- Assume no time zone or recurrence complexities (no repeated meetings)
- Participants are assumed to be available if a room is booked
- Concurrent bookings should be managed to avoid race conditions

## 🎨 Design Patterns to Consider

### Primary Topics
- **Scheduling algorithms**: Consider how this applies to the problem
- **Data modelling**: Consider how this applies to the problem

### Secondary Topics
- **Concurrency**: May be relevant for advanced implementation
- **Date/time handling**: May be relevant for advanced implementation

## 🧪 Test Cases to Consider

### Happy Path
1. Basic functionality works as expected
2. Multiple operations work in sequence
3. System handles normal load

### Edge Cases
1. Empty/null inputs
2. Boundary conditions
3. Maximum capacity scenarios

### Error Scenarios
1. Invalid operations
2. Resource conflicts
3. System constraints violations

## 📊 Success Criteria

- [ ] All functional requirements implemented
- [ ] Clean, maintainable code structure
- [ ] Proper error handling
- [ ] Thread safety (if applicable)
- [ ] Test coverage for main scenarios
- [ ] Time complexity within reasonable bounds

## 🔍 Questions to Clarify

1. What should happen in edge cases not explicitly mentioned?
2. Are there specific performance requirements?
3. Should the system handle concurrent operations?
4. What level of error reporting is expected?
