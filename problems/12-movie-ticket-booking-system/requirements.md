# Movie Ticket Booking System - Requirements Documentation

## 📋 Problem Overview

**Difficulty**: Medium  
**Time Limit**: 35min  
**Topics**: Transactional processing, Concurrency control

## 🎯 Business Context

A movie ticket booking system manages theater shows and seat reservations. Commonly referred to as a Box Office design problem, it involves classes for movies, theaters, and seating. It tests handling concurrent bookings and seat management (A frequently asked design question:contentReference[oaicite:10]{index=10}).

## 📝 Problem Statement

Design a movie ticket booking system. The system should allow searching for movies and shows, selecting seats in a theater, and booking tickets (with payments and ticket generation).

## ✅ Functional Requirements

### Core Features
1. **Maintain a schedule of movies and showtimes per theater hall**
2. **Allow users to view available seats for a selected show and select specific seats**
3. **Reserve selected seats during booking and handle payments**
4. **Confirm bookings by generating tickets with seat numbers**
5. **Handle cancellations and release seats back to availability**

## 🚫 Constraints & Assumptions

### Technical Constraints
- Theater seating is fixed; each seat is unique to a show
- Prevent double-booking of the same seat (handle concurrency)
- Fixed show schedule (no dynamic changes during booking flow)
- Payment processing can be mocked (focus on booking logic)
- Assume a finite number of theaters and shows

## 🎨 Design Patterns to Consider

### Primary Topics
- **Transactional processing**: Consider how this applies to the problem
- **Concurrency control**: Consider how this applies to the problem

### Secondary Topics
- **User interface flow**: May be relevant for advanced implementation
- **Data modelling**: May be relevant for advanced implementation

## 🧪 Test Cases to Consider

### Happy Path
1. Basic functionality works as expected
2. Multiple operations work in sequence
3. System handles normal load

### Edge Cases
1. Empty/null inputs
2. Boundary conditions
3. Maximum capacity scenarios

### Error Scenarios
1. Invalid operations
2. Resource conflicts
3. System constraints violations

## 📊 Success Criteria

- [ ] All functional requirements implemented
- [ ] Clean, maintainable code structure
- [ ] Proper error handling
- [ ] Thread safety (if applicable)
- [ ] Test coverage for main scenarios
- [ ] Time complexity within reasonable bounds

## 🔍 Questions to Clarify

1. What should happen in edge cases not explicitly mentioned?
2. Are there specific performance requirements?
3. Should the system handle concurrent operations?
4. What level of error reporting is expected?
