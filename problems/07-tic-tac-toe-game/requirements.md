# Tic-Tac-Toe Game - Requirements Documentation

## 📋 Problem Overview

**Difficulty**: Easy  
**Time Limit**: 25min  
**Topics**: Game design, Class modelling

## 🎯 Business Context

The Tic-Tac-Toe game (noughts and crosses) is often used to evaluate basic system design skills. Designing this game tests class modelling for players, game board, and rules. It is one of the most common LLD interview questions:contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}.

## 📝 Problem Statement

Design a Tic-Tac-Toe game for two players. The system should allow players to place marks on a 3x3 board in turns, check for win conditions (three in a row) or draw, and manage game state (start, play, end).

## ✅ Functional Requirements

### Core Features
1. **Represent a 3x3 game board and two players (X and O)**
2. **Allow players to make moves in turn, placing their mark on an empty cell**
3. **Check for game end conditions: win (three in a row) or draw (board full)**
4. **Support restarting or resetting the game**
5. **Optionally handle variable board sizes or more players (design extensibility)**

## 🚫 Constraints & Assumptions

### Technical Constraints
- Board size is fixed at 3x3 unless designing for general MxN
- Players must alternate turns correctly
- Invalid moves (cell already taken) are disallowed
- Game ends immediately when a win or draw is detected
- Stateless (simple console game), no need for persistence

## 🎨 Design Patterns to Consider

### Primary Topics
- **Game design**: Consider how this applies to the problem
- **Class modelling**: Consider how this applies to the problem

### Secondary Topics
- **Algorithms (win detection)**: May be relevant for advanced implementation
- **Testability**: May be relevant for advanced implementation

## 🧪 Test Cases to Consider

### Happy Path
1. Basic functionality works as expected
2. Multiple operations work in sequence
3. System handles normal load

### Edge Cases
1. Empty/null inputs
2. Boundary conditions
3. Maximum capacity scenarios

### Error Scenarios
1. Invalid operations
2. Resource conflicts
3. System constraints violations

## 📊 Success Criteria

- [ ] All functional requirements implemented
- [ ] Clean, maintainable code structure
- [ ] Proper error handling
- [ ] Thread safety (if applicable)
- [ ] Test coverage for main scenarios
- [ ] Time complexity within reasonable bounds

## 🔍 Questions to Clarify

1. What should happen in edge cases not explicitly mentioned?
2. Are there specific performance requirements?
3. Should the system handle concurrent operations?
4. What level of error reporting is expected?
