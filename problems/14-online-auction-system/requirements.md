# Online Auction System - Requirements Documentation

## 📋 Problem Overview

**Difficulty**: Medium  
**Time Limit**: 35min  
**Topics**: Observer pattern, Real-time processing

## 🎯 Business Context

An online auction (bidding) system like eBay allows users to list items and bid on them. This problem tests handling real-time bids, user accounts, and item listings. It often appears in interviews to assess event-driven design and concurrency (Frequently asked in interviews:contentReference[oaicite:12]{index=12}).

## 📝 Problem Statement

Design an online auction system. The system should allow users to create auction listings for items, other users to place bids, and automatically determine the winning bid when the auction ends.

## ✅ Functional Requirements

### Core Features
1. **User accounts to list items and place bids**
2. **Create auctions with a start time, end time, and initial price**
3. **Accept bids only higher than the current highest bid and before auction end**
4. **Automatically close the auction at end time and declare the highest bidder as the winner**
5. **Notify users (seller and winner) when auction ends**

## 🚫 Constraints & Assumptions

### Technical Constraints
- Each auction has one seller and multiple bidders
- Bids must be monotonically increasing; no reneging or proxy bidding needed
- Time synchronization (use consistent server time for end times)
- Assume auctions are not modified once created (no extensions)
- Handle concurrent bid submissions (synchronize to accept highest)

## 🎨 Design Patterns to Consider

### Primary Topics
- **Observer pattern**: Consider how this applies to the problem
- **Real-time processing**: Consider how this applies to the problem

### Secondary Topics
- **Concurrency control**: May be relevant for advanced implementation
- **Event scheduling**: May be relevant for advanced implementation

## 🧪 Test Cases to Consider

### Happy Path
1. Basic functionality works as expected
2. Multiple operations work in sequence
3. System handles normal load

### Edge Cases
1. Empty/null inputs
2. Boundary conditions
3. Maximum capacity scenarios

### Error Scenarios
1. Invalid operations
2. Resource conflicts
3. System constraints violations

## 📊 Success Criteria

- [ ] All functional requirements implemented
- [ ] Clean, maintainable code structure
- [ ] Proper error handling
- [ ] Thread safety (if applicable)
- [ ] Test coverage for main scenarios
- [ ] Time complexity within reasonable bounds

## 🔍 Questions to Clarify

1. What should happen in edge cases not explicitly mentioned?
2. Are there specific performance requirements?
3. Should the system handle concurrent operations?
4. What level of error reporting is expected?

**Note**: Focus on implementing the core requirements first, then add enhancements if time permits.
