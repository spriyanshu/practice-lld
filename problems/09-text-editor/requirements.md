# Text Editor - Requirements Documentation

## 📋 Problem Overview

**Difficulty**: Medium  
**Time Limit**: 35min  
**Topics**: Command pattern, Data structures (buffer)

## 🎯 Business Context

A text editor or word processor is a software tool for creating and editing documents. Designing a text editor (with undo/redo) is a classic OOD problem that tests understanding of design patterns like Command. (This is a known OOD interview question:contentReference[oaicite:8]{index=8}.)

## 📝 Problem Statement

Design a basic text editor supporting typing, deleting, and cursor movement. Include features like undo/redo of operations, copy/paste, and saving/loading documents.

## ✅ Functional Requirements

### Core Features
1. **Insert and delete text at the current cursor position**
2. **Move cursor (left, right, up, down) within the text buffer**
3. **Implement undo and redo of the last operations**
4. **Copy, cut, and paste text selections**
5. **Load text from a file and save text to a file**

## 🚫 Constraints & Assumptions

### Technical Constraints
- Assume a single-user editor (no collaborative features)
- Text is in memory (document size may fit in RAM; no streaming needed)
- Undo/redo stack size may be limited
- Operations should not exceed reasonable time for typical document sizes
- Focus on core features; formatting (fonts, images) not required

## 🎨 Design Patterns to Consider

### Primary Topics
- **Command pattern**: Consider how this applies to the problem
- **Data structures (buffer)**: Consider how this applies to the problem

### Secondary Topics
- **Undo/Redo implementation**: May be relevant for advanced implementation
- **File I/O**: May be relevant for advanced implementation

## 🧪 Test Cases to Consider

### Happy Path
1. Basic functionality works as expected
2. Multiple operations work in sequence
3. System handles normal load

### Edge Cases
1. Empty/null inputs
2. Boundary conditions
3. Maximum capacity scenarios

### Error Scenarios
1. Invalid operations
2. Resource conflicts
3. System constraints violations

## 📊 Success Criteria

- [ ] All functional requirements implemented
- [ ] Clean, maintainable code structure
- [ ] Proper error handling
- [ ] Thread safety (if applicable)
- [ ] Test coverage for main scenarios
- [ ] Time complexity within reasonable bounds

## 🔍 Questions to Clarify

1. What should happen in edge cases not explicitly mentioned?
2. Are there specific performance requirements?
3. Should the system handle concurrent operations?
4. What level of error reporting is expected?

**Note**: Focus on implementing the core requirements first, then add enhancements if time permits.
