# Library Management System - Requirements Documentation

## 📋 Problem Overview

**Difficulty**: Medium  
**Time Limit**: 35min  
**Topics**: Object-oriented design, Data modelling

## 🎯 Business Context

A library management system tracks books and borrowing by users. It is a common LLD interview problem:contentReference[oaicite:7]{index=7}. The system involves classes like Book, User, Library, and handles borrowing and returning of books.

## 📝 Problem Statement

Design a library management system where users can borrow and return books. The system should manage a catalog of books, track current loans, and allow users to search the catalog and reserve books.

## ✅ Functional Requirements

### Core Features
1. **Add and catalog new books with details (title, author, ISBN, copies)**
2. **User registration and management of borrower information**
3. **Loan operations: check out a book to a user, return a book**
4. **Track current availability (which copies are loaned out)**
5. **Search functionality by book title, author, or ISBN**

## 🚫 Constraints & Assumptions

### Technical Constraints
- A book may have multiple copies but only available copies can be loaned
- Users may have a limit on the number of simultaneous loans
- Handle reservations or waitlists when all copies are on loan (optional)
- Assume a single library branch (no multiple-branch logistics)
- Concurrency: ensure consistent updates when multiple checkouts/returns occur

## 🎨 Design Patterns to Consider

### Primary Topics
- **Object-oriented design**: Consider how this applies to the problem
- **Data modelling**: Consider how this applies to the problem

### Secondary Topics
- **Search algorithms**: May be relevant for advanced implementation
- **Database schema (for persistence)**: May be relevant for advanced implementation

## 🧪 Test Cases to Consider

### Happy Path
1. Basic functionality works as expected
2. Multiple operations work in sequence
3. System handles normal load

### Edge Cases
1. Empty/null inputs
2. Boundary conditions
3. Maximum capacity scenarios

### Error Scenarios
1. Invalid operations
2. Resource conflicts
3. System constraints violations

## 📊 Success Criteria

- [ ] All functional requirements implemented
- [ ] Clean, maintainable code structure
- [ ] Proper error handling
- [ ] Thread safety (if applicable)
- [ ] Test coverage for main scenarios
- [ ] Time complexity within reasonable bounds

## 🔍 Questions to Clarify

1. What should happen in edge cases not explicitly mentioned?
2. Are there specific performance requirements?
3. Should the system handle concurrent operations?
4. What level of error reporting is expected?
