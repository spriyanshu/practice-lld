# LRU Cache - Requirements Documentation

## 📋 Problem Overview

**Difficulty**: Easy  
**Time Limit**: 25min  
**Topics**: Hash map, Doubly linked list

## 🎯 Business Context

An LRU (Least Recently Used) cache stores key-value pairs with limited capacity, evicting the least recently used item when full. Designing an LRU cache is a classic data structure and design interview problem. It tests understanding of hashing and linked structures (Also a common interview question:contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}.)

## 📝 Problem Statement

Design and implement an LRU cache with capacity 'N'. The cache should support 'get(key)' and 'put(key, value)' operations in O(1) time, evicting the least recently used item when capacity is exceeded.

## ✅ Functional Requirements

### Core Features
1. **get(key): Return the value if present in cache, otherwise return null/indicator of miss**
2. **put(key, value): Insert or update the value for the key, and if capacity exceeded, evict the least recently used item**
3. **Maintain insertion and access order to identify the least recently used item**
4. **Clear or reset cache operations (optional enhancement)**

## 🚫 Constraints & Assumptions

### Technical Constraints
- Assume multi-thread access is not required (single-threaded LRU)
- Limited capacity that triggers eviction when full
- Duplicate keys overwrite existing entries (update usage order)
- Focus on in-memory structure (persistence not needed)
- Optimal O(1) time complexity for operations is expected

## 🎨 Design Patterns to Consider

### Primary Topics
- **Hash map**: Consider how this applies to the problem
- **Doubly linked list**: Consider how this applies to the problem

### Secondary Topics
- **Design optimization**: May be relevant for advanced implementation
- **Cache invalidation**: May be relevant for advanced implementation

## 🧪 Test Cases to Consider

### Happy Path
1. Basic functionality works as expected
2. Multiple operations work in sequence
3. System handles normal load

### Edge Cases
1. Empty/null inputs
2. Boundary conditions
3. Maximum capacity scenarios

### Error Scenarios
1. Invalid operations
2. Resource conflicts
3. System constraints violations

## 📊 Success Criteria

- [ ] All functional requirements implemented
- [ ] Clean, maintainable code structure
- [ ] Proper error handling
- [ ] Thread safety (if applicable)
- [ ] Test coverage for main scenarios
- [ ] Time complexity within reasonable bounds

## 🔍 Questions to Clarify

1. What should happen in edge cases not explicitly mentioned?
2. Are there specific performance requirements?
3. Should the system handle concurrent operations?
4. What level of error reporting is expected?

**Note**: Focus on implementing the core requirements first, then add enhancements if time permits.
