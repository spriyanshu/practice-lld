# ATM Machine - Requirements Documentation

## 📋 Problem Overview

**Difficulty**: Easy  
**Time Limit**: 25min  
**Topics**: Security (Authentication), Concurrency

## 🎯 Business Context

An Automated Teller Machine (ATM) allows bank customers to withdraw cash, deposit money, and check balances. Designing an ATM is a classic OOD interview problem:contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}. The context involves modeling user authentication, cash dispensing, and transaction processing.

## 📝 Problem Statement

Design an ATM system that supports user authentication and basic banking operations. The system should handle multiple accounts, allow withdrawals, deposits, balance inquiries, and dispense cash in appropriate denominations.

## ✅ Functional Requirements

### Core Features
1. **Authenticate users (e.g., via card and PIN) before allowing transactions**
2. **Support withdraw, deposit, balance check, and possibly transfer functions**
3. **Dispense cash in available denominations and track cash inventory**
4. **Print or display transaction receipts**
5. **Allow multi-language user interfaces (optional)**

## 🚫 Constraints & Assumptions

### Technical Constraints
- Daily withdrawal limits per account
- Cash slot limitations (denominations and quantities)
- Ensure transactions are atomic and consistent (no double-withdraw if interrupted)
- High availability and security (safe PIN handling)
- Concurrency: multiple ATMs can access central account database

## 🎨 Design Patterns to Consider

### Primary Topics
- **Security (Authentication)**: Consider how this applies to the problem
- **Concurrency**: Consider how this applies to the problem

### Secondary Topics
- **State pattern**: May be relevant for advanced implementation
- **Transaction management**: May be relevant for advanced implementation

## 🧪 Test Cases to Consider

### Happy Path
1. Basic functionality works as expected
2. Multiple operations work in sequence
3. System handles normal load

### Edge Cases
1. Empty/null inputs
2. Boundary conditions
3. Maximum capacity scenarios

### Error Scenarios
1. Invalid operations
2. Resource conflicts
3. System constraints violations

## 📊 Success Criteria

- [ ] All functional requirements implemented
- [ ] Clean, maintainable code structure
- [ ] Proper error handling
- [ ] Thread safety (if applicable)
- [ ] Test coverage for main scenarios
- [ ] Time complexity within reasonable bounds

## 🔍 Questions to Clarify

1. What should happen in edge cases not explicitly mentioned?
2. Are there specific performance requirements?
3. Should the system handle concurrent operations?
4. What level of error reporting is expected?
